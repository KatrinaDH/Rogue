        <p>When I was about 4 years old I have my first memory of my mother cooking in the kitchen. My whole life has consisted of
          cooking and tasting new foods. Once I was 18 I jumped right into cooking full time, bouncing restaurant to restaurant trying to learn
          and grow from the best in the business. Now after almost 10 years of laerning and growing, I decided to open Rogue Pickings and start my
          life long dream of being a restaurant owner. My goal was to make sure every customer wanted to come back for more! Here at Rogue Pickings
          I believe you deserve the most fresh food we have to offer you. Enjoy and welcome to the Rogue Pickings Family!</p>
